    <p>It allows more freedom to your employees, they'll waste less time 
        commuting to work and are able to be more productive as they would 
        be happier working with such a good work-life balance. 
        In addition, you may not even need to have a large office space or
         place little office supplies, hence less expenses there for you.</p>

     <p>another advantages of working from home is doing away with traveling time.
         This saves time and gives way to better productivity as you don't need to travel 
         to the office. 
         For example, a task that used to take 4 days to complete on a normal office day,
          can be completed in less time when working from home.</p>

      <p>However there are other things also to consider, UN's International Labour Organisation (ILO)
         has concluded that working from home can lead to insomnia and increased stress levels.
          It found that although the usage of modern telecommunication facilitates a better 
          work-life balance overall, consequently it also tends to blur the boundaries between work 
          and private life, exacerbating work stress.</p>

       <p>One of the most negative impact on working from home is that it hampers innovation and 
        creative thinking.Innovations are born from interactions with people through different 
        ideas and areas of expertise. Knowledge sharing is the key to innovation and creative 
        thinking. If you are isolating yourself at home, how are you able to challenge your own 
        thoughts and generate ideas if you do not have regular face-to-face interactions with your 
        colleagues and co-workers?</p>    
        <p>we can conclude with this, work from home is good option for few like for women specially for mothers ,
             however the one who is having the option to work from office has better chances for career growth.
